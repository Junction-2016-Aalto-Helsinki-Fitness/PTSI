<h1 id="how-to-install">How to install</h1>
<p>Take this project and put it into some directory on your machine (typically we call the directory ChatScript, but you can name it whatever). That takes care of installation.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-run-locally">How to run locally</h1>
<p>Go to the BINARIES directory and type <code>ChatScript</code> if you are on Windows, or type <code>./LinuxChatScript64 local</code> if you are on Linux. This will cause ChatScript to load and ask you for a username. Enter whatever you want. You are then talking to the default demo bot <code>Harry</code>.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-run-as-a-server">How to run as a server</h1>
<p>Go to the BINARIES directory and type <code>ChatScript port=1024</code> if you are on Windows, or type <code>./LinuxChatScript64</code> if you are on Linux. This will cause ChatScript to load as a server. But you also need a client. You can run a separate command window and go to the BINARIES directory and type <code>ChatScript client=localhost:1024</code> if you are on Windows, or type <code>./LinuxChatScript64 client=localhost:1024</code> if you are on Linux. This will cause ChatScript to load as a client and you can talk to the server.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-compile-the-engine.">How to compile the engine.</h1>
<p>On windows if you have Visual Studio installed, launch VS2010/chatscript.sln or VS2015/chatscript.sln and do a build. The result will go in the BINARIES directory.</p>
<p>On Linux, go stand in the SRC directory and type <code>make server</code> (assuming you have make and g++ installed). This creates BINARIES/ChatScript, which can run as a server or locally. There are other make choices for installing PostGres or Mongo.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-compile-a-bot">how to compile a bot</h1>
<p>Run ChatScript locally. From the command prompt, type ':build Harry' or whatever other preinstalled bot exists. If you have revised basic data, you can first do ':build 0' .</p>
