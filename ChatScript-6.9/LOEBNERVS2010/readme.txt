WARNING- this builds a version that uses std windows DLL's and worked for me in 2014, BUT...
some machine MIGHT be lacking a critical DLL. I would prefer to build it with static linking so
the EXE would be completely stand-alone, but when I tried, it failed to find some DLL needed for
boring windows things. If someone can figure it out (I have no time to waste on it), then I'll
make it static link in the future.



To run the judge program to interact with your loebner chatbot, you must have perl installed.

Assuming you do, you can type into a dos command window: perl judge.pl
This brings up a 4-way window and follow its instructions"

Now, run your chatbot until it says initialization complete.

Then type into the judge window on the chatbot side.
